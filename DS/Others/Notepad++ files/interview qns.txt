Technical round questions: I was asked about my projects and conceptual questions like batch normalization, dropout, regularization, data augmentation, early stopping, CNN related questions(filter size, resnet, etc). The interviewers were knowledgeable and the questions and discussions were very good. It was followed by a managerial round in which again there are technical discussions and role-level discussions.
